# Hi There!

So you want to know more about me.

Professionally, I'm a Computer Engineer, and I work at
[Cover](https://cover.com/) as a Full Stack developer.

In my spare time, I like to saciate my curiosity by learning a bunch of different
things that aren't necessarially related to technology.

This site is still under construction, but I will soon update it with some links
to some random shenannigans I've been up to.
